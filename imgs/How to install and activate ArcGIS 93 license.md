Once you have an authorization code, open ArcGIS Administrator from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. Select Desktop in the left pane and click on Authorize Now in the right pane. Enter your authorization code and click Next. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the activation process.
 
Congratulations! You have successfully installed and activated ArcGIS 9.3 license on your computer. You can now start using ArcGIS 9.3 to create and explore spatial data.
  
## Step 4: Explore the features of ArcGIS 9.3
 
ArcGIS 9.3 is a powerful and versatile GIS software that offers many features and functions to help you create and analyze spatial data. Some of the features of ArcGIS 9.3 are:
 
- **Mapping and visualization:** You can create and display maps with various symbols, labels, layouts, and effects. You can also use tools such as ArcMap, ArcScene, and ArcGlobe to visualize your data in different dimensions and perspectives.
- **Editing and data compilation:** You can edit your data using tools such as sketch, reshape, split, merge, and topology. You can also compile data from different sources and formats using tools such as geodatabase, geoprocessing, and data conversion.
- **Geoprocessing:** You can perform spatial analysis and modeling using tools such as buffer, clip, intersect, dissolve, and spatial join. You can also create custom geoprocessing tools and models using tools such as ModelBuilder and Python scripting.
- **Geodatabases and ArcSDE:** You can store and manage your data using geodatabases, which are collections of spatial and attribute data organized by feature classes, tables, and relationships. You can also use ArcSDE to connect to relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.
- **Data support in ArcGIS:** You can work with various types of data in ArcGIS, such as vector, raster, image, CAD, GPS, web services, and metadata. You can also access data that comes with ArcGIS, such as basemaps, street maps, imagery, elevation, hydrology, and demographics.
- **Extensions:** You can enhance the functionality of ArcGIS by using extensions, which are additional software components that provide specialized capabilities. Some of the extensions available for ArcGIS 9.3 are Spatial Analyst, 3D Analyst, Network Analyst, Geostatistical Analyst, Tracking Analyst, and Data Interoperability.
- **Geocoding and address management:** You can locate addresses and places on a map using geocoding tools such as address locators and geocoding services. You can also manage your address data using tools such as address matching, standardization, parsing, and validation.
- **Linear referencing:** You can store and analyze data that is referenced by linear measurements along a network, such as roads or pipelines. You can also use tools such as dynamic segmentation, route editing, event tables, calibration points, and measures.
- **Network analysis:** You can perform network analysis on transportation or utility networks using tools such as shortest path, closest facility, service area, location-allocation, vehicle routing problem (VRP), origin-destination cost matrix (ODCM), network dataset editor (NDE), and network analyst toolbar.
- **Mobile GIS:** You can extend your GIS capabilities to mobile devices using tools such as ArcPad and ArcGIS Mobile. You can also use tools such as ArcGIS Server Mobile ADF (application development framework) and ArcGIS Mobile SDK (software development kit) to create custom mobile applications.
- **Interoperability and standards support:** You can exchange data with other systems and applications using tools such as data interoperability extension (DIE), web map services (WMS), web feature services (WFS), web coverage services (WCS), keyhole markup language (KML), geography markup language (GML), simple features access (SFA), open geospatial consortium (OGC), international organization for standardization (ISO), federal geographic data committee (FGDC), national spatial data infrastructure (NSDI), metadata explorer (ME), metadata editor (MDE), metadata importer (MDI), metadata exporter (MDE), metadata style sheets (MSS), metadata validator (MV), metadata publisher (MP), metadata harvester (MH), metadata crawler (MC), metadata synchronizer (MS).
- **Customizing and developing with ArcGIS:** You can customize and develop your own GIS applications using tools such as ArcObjects SDKs for .NET Framework or Java Platform; Visual Basic for Applications (VBA); Python scripting; command line utilities; macros; tool 0f148eb4a0
